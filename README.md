# Swagger JavaScript library

This is the Wordnik Swagger JavaScript client for use with [Swagger](http://swagger.wordnik.com)-enabled APIs. It's written in CoffeeScript and tested with Jasmine, and is the fastest way to enable a JavaScript client to communicate with a Swagger-enabled server.

## What's Swagger?

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.


Check out [Swagger-Spec](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more.


## Compatability
The Swagger Specification has undergone 3 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  The swagger-js project has the following compatibilies with the Swagger specification:

Swagger JS Version      | Release Date | Swagger Spec compatability | Notes
----------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | -----
2.1.0 (in development)  | n/a          |      2.0      | [branch develop_2.0](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js/tree/develop_2.0)
2.0.41                  | 2014-09-18   | 1.1, 1.2      | [tag v2.0.41](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js/tree/v2.0.41)
1.0.4                   | 2013-06-26   | 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 | [tag v1.0.4](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js/tree/v1.0.4)

### Calling an API with Swagger + Node.js!

Install swagger-client:
```
npm install swagger-client
```

Then let Swagger do the work!
```js
var client = require("swagger-client")

var swagger = new client.SwaggerApi({
  url: 'http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs',
  success: function() {
    if(swagger.ready === true) {
      swagger.apis.pet.getPetById({petId:1});
    }
  }
});

```

That's it!  You'll get a JSON response with the default callback handler:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "category": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Cats"
  },
  "name": "Cat 1",
  "photoUrls": [
    "url1",
    "url2"
  ],
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "tag1"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "tag2"
    }
  ],
  "status": "available"
}
```

Need to pass an API key?  Configure one as a querystring:

```js
client.authorizations.add("apiKey", new client.ApiKeyAuthorization("api_key","special-key","query"));
```

...or with a header:

```js
client.authorizations.add("apiKey", new client.ApiKeyAuthorization("api_key","special-key","header"));
```

### Calling an API with Swagger + the browser!

Download `swagger.js` and `shred.bundle.js` into your lib folder

```html
<script src='lib/shred.bundle.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
<script src='lib/swagger.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  // initialize swagger, point to a resource listing
  window.swagger = new SwaggerApi({
    url: "http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs",
    success: function() {
      if(swagger.ready === true) {
        // upon connect, fetch a pet and set contents to element "mydata"
        swagger.apis.pet.getPetById({petId:1}, function(data) {
          document.getElementById("mydata").innerHTML = data.content.data;
        });
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```

### Need to send an object to your API via POST or PUT?
```js
var body = {
  id: 100,
  name: "dog"
};

swagger.apis.pet.addPet({body: JSON.stringify(body)});
```

### Sending XML in as a payload to your API?
```js
var body = "<Pet><id>2</id><name>monster</name></Pet>";

swagger.apis.pet.addPet({body: body},{requestContentType:"application/xml"});
```

### Need XML response?
```js
swagger.apis.pet.getPetById({petId:1},{responseContentType:"application/xml"});
```

### Custom request signing
You can easily write your own request signing code for Swagger.  For example:

```js
var CustomRequestSigner = function(name) {
  this.name = name;
};

CustomRequestSigner.prototype.apply = function(obj, authorizations) {
  var hashFunction = this._btoa;
  var hash = hashFunction(obj.url);

  obj.headers["signature"] = hash;
  return true;
};
```

In the above simple example, we're creating a new request signer that simply base 64 encodes the URL.  Of course you'd do something more sophisticated, but after encoding it, a header called `signature` is set before sending the request.

### How does it work?
The Swagger JavaScript client reads the Swagger api definition directly from the server.  As it does, it constructs a client based on the api definition, which means it is completely dynamic.  It even reads the api text descriptions (which are intended for humans!) and provides help if you need it:

```js
s.apis.pet.getPetById.help()
'* petId (required) - ID of pet that needs to be fetched'
```

The HTTP requests themselves are handled by the excellent [shred](https://github.com/automatthew/shred) library, which has a ton of features itself.  But it runs on both node and the browser.


Development
-----------

Please [fork the code](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js) and help us improve
swagger.js. Send us a pull request and **we'll mail you a wordnik T-shirt!**

Swagger.js is written in CoffeeScript, so you'll need Node.js and the
CoffeeScript compiler. For more detailed installation instructions, see
[coffeescript.org/#installation](http://coffeescript.org/#installation).

```bash
# generate the JavaScript libraries and put them in the `lib` folder

npm run-script build
```

```bash
# The 'dev' task will:
# 1. Open source files in your $EDITOR
# 2. Open and run the Jasmine specs in your browser.
# 3. Watch for changes to CoffeeScript files and auto-compile them to Javascript.

npm run-script dev

# List all cake tasks:
cake
```
