**Swagger Client** is a JavaScript module that allows you to fetch, resolve, and interact with Swagger/OpenAPI documents.

## New!

**This is the new version of swagger-js, 3.x.** The new version supports Swagger 2.0 as well as OpenAPI 3.

Want to learn more? Check out our [FAQ](docs/migration/migration-2-x-to-3-x.md).

For features known to be missing from 3.x please see the [Graveyard](docs/migration/graveyard-3-x.md).


For the older version of swagger-js, refer to the [*2.x branch*](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/tree/2.x).


> *The npm package is called `swagger-client` and the GitHub repository is `swagger-js`.
We'll be consolidating that soon. Just giving you the heads up. You may see references to both names.*
