    A client side JS error occured when the throwError endpoint was expanded in
    the UI Docs panel. This error was specifically visible when a $ref is seen
    by the subtree resolver after an allOf or after an anyOf. E.g. the subtree
    resolver was treating the $ref as a reference instead as an object.
